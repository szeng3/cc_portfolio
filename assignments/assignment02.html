        <h2>Face Generator</h2>
      <h3>Face</h3>
      <p>I draft my two phase of the faces on illustrator as reference and guideline to make the alternation on the face
      <p>I codes the face by sections, starting from the face(circle),eyes(L,R), blush(L,R), mouth. After I finished the the base face, I added on the shape change effects on the face by sections and at last, added on the color change effect for each of the sections.
