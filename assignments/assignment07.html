            <h2> Autobiographical Game</h2>
            <h3>Background stroy</h3>
            <p>This autobiographical game relates to one of my experience of designing a set of tarot card. It was a research study that delicated in deisgn the aesthetic graphic of the tarod card, then tested the card with user to flip the cards and do the reading of the flips. 
            <p>I was inspired by this experience and decided to make a game with a similar tarot reading's mechanism of flipping cards in an entertaining way. The game will have a 4x4 grid that allow players to clik on the space and flip the cards. If two cards are the same the set of cards will stay; otherwise, the cards will flip back and the player will have to take another attempt to flip two same cards. When the player finshs all the card flipping, the player will win the game.
