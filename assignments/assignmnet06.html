      <p>I documented the number of steps that I walked for this week through the "HEATLH" function in Iphone. 

        <p>Here is my data:

          <p>D1: 7670
            <p>D2: 6687
              <p>D3: 4771
                <p>D4: 6972
                  <p>D5: 13357
                    <p>D6: 11239
                      <p>D7: 8852
<p>Due to the number is too many, I decided to take the numbers and divide them by 100, only taking the integer part.

  <p>My plan is to make the certain amount of balls for each number of value falling from the top of the canvas to the bottom. Then, click to switch to the next value in the order, and switch the color too. 

    <p>Through the data visualization, the amount of step count for each day could be seen better and known the value difference in the form of volume instead of number.
