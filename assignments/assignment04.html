      <h2>Exquisite Corpse</h2>
      <h3>Background stroy</h3>
      <p>This is a creature with a sweet and kind appearence that will always make poeple think it's a symbol of a cute and nice figure. While there are 2 sets of hands, one in the back and one on the side, that also shows the evilness of hiding something behind.  
      </p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>I developed this figure starting from the head portion layer by layer. One of the difficulties is, I always get messed up by the complicated code with mass of vertexes and cordinantes.
